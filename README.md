### üîí Smart Data Validation
* **Automatic validation** of uploaded data for empty files, missing columns, and invalid marks
* **Warning system** for marks outside the 0-100 range
* **Error prevention** with clear, helpful error messages and troubleshooting tips

### ‚úÖ Grade Boundary Validation
* **Real-time validation** ensures grade boundaries are in logical descending order (A > A- > B > B-, etc.)
* **Instant feedback** when boundaries are set incorrectly
* **Prevents grading errors** before they happen

* **Interactive Grade Boundaries:** Go beyond fixed grading scales. Use dynamic, high-precision sliders in the sidebar to set the exact minimum mark required for each letter grade (A, A-, B, B-, etc.). This feature is perfect for applying curves or testing different grading scenarios on the fly to see their immediate impact.

* **Instant Feedback Loop:** The entire dashboard is fully reactive. As you adjust a grade boundary slider, the histogram, summary statistics, and the final graded list all update in real-time. This eliminates guesswork and provides an immediate understanding of how your changes affect the final grade distribution.

* **Rich Data Visualization:**
    * **Marks Distribution Histogram:** A clear and informative histogram visualizes the frequency distribution of student marks. This chart is crucial for quickly identifying trends, such as clusters of high-achievers or students who are struggling. It is enhanced with vertical lines that dynamically update to show exactly where your grade cutoffs fall, providing powerful visual context.

    * **Grade Summary Chart:** A clean bar chart displays the total number of students who achieved each letter grade. This provides a high-level overview perfect for reports and understanding the overall class performance at a glance.

* **In-Depth Detailed Analysis:**
    * **Key Summary Statistics:** The dashboard presents crucial statistical metrics, including the mean (average score), median (the middle score), standard deviation (measure of score spread), highest/lowest marks, and total student count.
    * **Color-Coded Graded List:** A beautifully formatted, sortable table with color-coded grades for easy visualization (green for A/A-, blue for B/B-, yellow for C/C-, red for D/E/F).
    * **Pass/Fail Analytics:** Automatic calculation of pass rate and fail rate with visual metrics.
    * **Percentage Distribution:** View the percentage of students in each grade category.

### üíæ Export Functionality
* **Download Graded Results:** Export the complete graded student list as a CSV file
* **Multiple Download Points:** Download buttons in both the sidebar and the graded list tab
* **Ready for Record-Keeping:** Perfect for uploading to your LMS or keeping for your records

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
To run this application on your local machine, please follow these detailed steps. No prior web development experience is needed.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or higher: The core programming language this application is built on. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.
* `pip` **(Python package installer):** This is the standard tool for installing Python packages and is included with most Python installations.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to get the project files onto your computer. You can do this by "cloning" the repository using Git, which is the recommended method if you want to stay updated.

```js
git clone https://github.com/shubham050802/Auto_Grading_Tool.git
cd Auto_Grading_Tool
```

Alternatively, if you are not familiar with Git, you can download the project as a ZIP file from the main repository page on GitHub and extract it.

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project relies on several external Python libraries. The `requirements.txt` file lists all of them. You can install them all with a single command:

```js
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command tells `pip` to read the file and install the specific versions of the libraries needed to run the application.

### 3. Run the Streamlit App
With the dependencies installed, you can now launch the application.

```js
streamlit run grading_tool.py
```

This command starts a local web server. Your default web browser will automatically open a new tab, and you will see the Interactive Grading Tool live and ready to use.
