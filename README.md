# üéì Interactive Grading Tool

An intuitive and powerful web application built with Streamlit designed to help educators, teachers, and instructors grade student marks, visualize complex distributions, and analyze class performance interactively. This tool moves beyond static spreadsheets by providing a dynamic interface to explore grading scenarios and gain deeper insights into student performance.The application is designed for anyone in an educational role who needs to translate numerical scores into grades efficiently. By automating the grading process and providing immediate visual feedback, it saves valuable time and helps in making more informed decisions about grade boundaries and overall class assessment.‚ú®

## Features
* **Flexible File Upload:** Supports the most common file formats used in education, including CSV (.csv) and Excel (.xlsx, .xls). This ensures you can use your existing mark sheets without any need for conversion. The tool intelligently reads the first sheet of an Excel workbook.

* **Interactive Grade Boundaries:** Go beyond fixed grading scales. Use dynamic, high-precision sliders in the sidebar to set the exact minimum mark required for each letter grade (A, A-, B, B-, etc.). This feature is perfect for applying curves or testing different grading scenarios on the fly to see their immediate impact.

* **Instant Feedback Loop:** The entire dashboard is fully reactive. As you adjust a grade boundary slider, the histogram, summary statistics, and the final graded list all update in real-time. This eliminates guesswork and provides an immediate understanding of how your changes affect the final grade distribution.

* **Rich Data Visualization:**
    * **Marks Distribution Histogram:** A clear and informative histogram visualizes the frequency distribution of student marks. This chart is crucial for quickly identifying trends, such as clusters of high-achievers or students who are struggling. It is enhanced with vertical lines that dynamically update to show exactly where your grade cutoffs fall, providing powerful visual context.
    * **Grade Summary Chart:** A clean bar chart displays the total number of students who achieved each letter grade. This provides a high-level overview perfect for reports and understanding the overall class performance at a glance.
    
* **In-Depth Detailed Analysis:** 
    * **Key Summary Statistics:** The dashboard presents crucial statistical metrics, including the mean (average score), median (the middle score), standard deviation (measure of score spread), and the highest/lowest marks. These numbers help you quantitatively assess class performance and consistency.
    * **Full Graded List:** For complete transparency and record-keeping, the tool displays a full, sortable table containing the original student data alongside the newly assigned letter grades. This allows for easy verification and can be used for exporting or manual review.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
To run this application on your local machine, please follow these detailed steps. No prior web development experience is needed.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.7 or higher: The core programming language this application is built on. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.
* `pip` **(Python package installer):** This is the standard tool for installing Python packages and is included with most Python installations.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to get the project files onto your computer. You can do this by "cloning" the repository using Git, which is the recommended method if you want to stay updated.

```js
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

Alternatively, if you are not familiar with Git, you can download the project as a ZIP file from the main repository page on GitHub and extract it.

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project relies on several external Python libraries. The `requirements.txt` file lists all of them. You can install them all with a single command:

```js
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command tells `pip` to read the file and install the specific versions of the libraries needed to run the application.

#### 3. Run the Streamlit App
With the dependencies installed, you can now launch the application.

```js
streamlit run Grading_tool.py
```

This command starts a local web server. Your default web browser will automatically open a new tab, and you will see the Interactive Grading Tool live and ready to use.

### üìÇ Project Files
* `Grading_tool.py`: The main Python script that contains all the application logic, from the user interface to the data processing and visualizations.
* `requirements.txt`: The dependency list. This file is crucial for ensuring the application runs correctly in any environment by specifying the necessary libraries.

### üì¶ Dependencies
This project relies on the following powerful Python libraries:

* `streamlit`: The core framework used to build and run the interactive web application.
* `pandas`: The essential library for data manipulation and analysis; used here to read and process the uploaded CSV and Excel files.
* `numpy`: A fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, used for handling numerical data efficiently.
* `matplotlib`: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations; used to generate the histogram.
* `openpyxl`: A specialized library that allows pandas to read and write modern Excel (.xlsx) files.
